**Description**:

- This study has explored the positive and negative effects of Paradoxes of Implication (POI) sentences and the importance of including POI in a logical system.
- It is motivated by the fact that many logical systems have explicitly rejected the existence of POI, yet POI is used in everyday language.
- One positive effect of POI in everyday language is emphasis, when “p” is a hyperbolic false statement in a sentence with the structures of “⊥ ⊢ p” or “p ⊢ T”, such as the sentence “If I had committed the crime, the sky would fall down,” spoken by a factually innocent person.
- The downside is that the misuse of POI by a dishonest person can be misleading, such as the sentence “If the sun were the moon, I would be an excellent student,” spoken by an average student, because people sometimes focus more on the consequent rather than the antecedent and contemplate a counterfactual scenario, instead of strictly following the logical interpretation.
- The goal of the study is to demonstrate that, when designing a logical system, POI must be handled with care to encompass and represent the nuances of natural language, particularly in the development of symbolic AI for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
